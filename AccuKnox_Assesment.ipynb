    "Django signals typically run in the same thread as the caller. Since signals are executed synchronously by default, the signal handlers are executed in the same thread that triggers the signal.

    "By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Django signals do not run in the same database transaction as the caller, unless they are explicitly wrapped in a transaction. This means that signals, such as post_save, are executed after the database transaction has been committed, and the changes have been saved to the database. If the transaction fails or is rolled back, the signal handlers will not be executed unless the signal itself is triggered within a transaction block.\n",
    "To prove this, we can use a code snippet that demonstrates how signals behave when a database transaction is rolled back. We'll use Django's transaction.atomic() to manage the transaction and simulate a rollback."

    "The signal handler my_signal_handler is still called after the object creation, but since the transaction is rolled back, the object will not persist in the database. This demonstrates that, by default, Django signals are not automatically tied to the transaction lifecycle, meaning they are called even if the transaction fails.
